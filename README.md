This is a project for the course Algorithms for information retrieval and intelligent web 2024
I have made a retrieval system for images from text prompt and images from image prompt
Used CLIP, FAISS, VBERT and siamese(failed attempt) for TBIR
Used CLIP and DINO with FAISS for image-image retrieval

Wish to build on the second system for user relevance feedback also  

Please use this Google drive for the pkl embeddings, captions and indexes - i have also attached working video
