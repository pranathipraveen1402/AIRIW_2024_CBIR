This is a project for the course Algorithms for information retrieval and intelligent web 2024. 
 I have made a retrieval system for images from text prompt and images from image prompt.  
 Used CLIP, FAISS, VBERT and siamese network for TBIR.
 Used CLIP and DINO with FAISS for image-image retrieval

Wish to build on the second system for user relevance feedback also  

Please use this Google drive for the pkl embeddings, captions and indexes - i have also attached working video
